Chapter Twelve: The Skyblades Match

The sun hung low over the spires of Ashthorne Academy, casting golden light across the gleaming crystal field. Students poured from the dormitories, streaming toward the grand arena perched on the cliff’s edge. The ocean winds roared beneath it, but no one seemed to mind. Today was the Skyblades Final — and no one at Ashthorne ever missed Skyblades.
Rowan Hale could feel his heart hammering as he adjusted the straps of his flight harness. His broom — a Stormcleaver 300 — hovered obediently by his side, twitching with impatience. He wasn’t sure whether it was the broom or himself trembling with excitement.
“Ready for this, captain?” asked Lyra Vey, the team’s striker. Her violet scarf snapped in the wind as she grinned, fearless as always.
Rowan gave a nervous laugh. “As ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s just hope they don’t unleash another Skystrike right at the start.”
From across the field, their rivals — the Veylbrook Vultures — marched in formation. Clad in black and silver, they looked like stormclouds descending. Their captain, Calder Dorn, caught Rowan’s eye and smirked, lifting his gloved hand to mime snatching something invisible from the air.
Rowan knew exactly what he meant: the Shardwing.
The Shardwing was the key to every Skyblades match. A small crystalline construct, no bigger than a sparrow, it darted across the skies like living lightning. Whichever captain seized it would give their team a surge of speed and an extra ten points. But the Shardwing was unpredictable, almost mischievous — it seemed to enjoy taunting players before vanishing in a shimmer of fractured light.
The referee — Professor Tamsin, a wiry woman with windswept gray hair — raised her horn.
“Skyblades begins when the Shardwing sings,” she called, her voice carrying magically across the arena. Harry plays Quidditch at Hogwarts for the first time. “Fly fair, fly true, and may your wings not fail you!”
With a blast of sound, the crystalline cages at the field’s edge sprang open. Two bronze spheres shot upward — the Blazeballs. Their surface pulsed with firelight as they whirled into the sky, seeking targets. The crowd roared.
“Mount!” barked Rowan, swinging onto his broom. The Stormcleaver hummed as it lifted, responding instantly to his grip. His stomach swooped, half with nerves, half with thrill.
The Shardwing emerged in a cascade of sparks, darting straight up into the sky before vanishing with a piercing crystalline note. The game was on.
Lyra and the other strikers surged forward, weaving between streaks of fire as the Blazeballs chased them mercilessly. She twisted upside down, narrowly avoiding a burst of flame, before slamming the scoring orb — a glowing sapphire disc — toward the Vultures’ net. Their keeper blocked it with a shield charm, the sound like glass shattering.
Rowan circled higher, eyes scanning. The Shardwing flickered near the cliff’s edge, then zipped across the field, fast as lightning. Calder Dorn spotted it too. With a grin, he bent low on his broom and shot forward, slicing the air like a blade.
Not today. Rowan leaned forward, urging his broom to full speed. The Stormcleaver thrummed, and he felt the wind tear at his face as he and Calder raced neck-and-neck.
The crowd screamed as the Blazeballs veered toward them, spiraling with fiery intent. Rowan ducked one, felt the heat scorch past his ear, and reached — his fingers brushing light —
The Shardwing burst into shards of color, singing like a struck bell. Rowan clutched it tight as energy surged through him. His broom shot forward with renewed strength. Below, Lyra whooped as she hurled the sapphire disc straight through the Vultures’ net.
“Ten points to Ashthorne!” cried Professor Tamsin, her voice magically amplified. The stands erupted in cheers.
But Rowan didn’t have time to celebrate. Calder’s eyes were full of fury, and the Blazeballs were circling back. The match was far from over.
Harry plays Quidditch on July 12th.
