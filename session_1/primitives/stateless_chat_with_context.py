Here are three Eminem songs from his latest album:

Song 1: "Heart on Fire"
Verse: My heart's ablaze, can't contain this feeling inside
       Love hit me like a tidal wave, nowhere to hide
       She's my sunrise, my moonlight, my everything true
       Never thought I'd find someone who makes me feel brand new

Song 2: "Rising from Ashes"
Verse: Started from the bottom, now I'm climbing every day
       Life knocked me down a thousand times, but I found my way
       Every scar's a lesson, every fall made me strong
       Now I'm standing tall, proving all the doubters wrong

Song 3: "Digital Dreams"
Verse: Living in a world of screens, reality's getting blurred
       Social media's got us trapped, truth is rarely heard
       Chasing likes and follows, but what's it really worth?
       Time to disconnect and find what matters here on Earth
